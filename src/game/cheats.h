// Cheats (issue #20): Action Replay style codes, i.e. 68K work RAM bytes the
// host sets before every frame. Game Genie codes are not supported: they
// patch ROM bytes, mostly instructions, and the game runs as statically
// recompiled code, so a patched instruction would not be the one executed.
//
// The built-in list is the subset of the community's codes (Sonic Retro's
// Knuckles' Chaotix page) that was checked against this game; the player can
// add their own in Config/chaotix.ini. While any cheat is on, achievements
// and time attack records are not earned.
